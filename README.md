## Well-Being comparison between OECD Countries

How does your country perform when it comes to education, environment, safety and other topics important to your well-being?

Using data from the [OECD Regional Well-Being iniciative](https://www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org/), I created a Shiny App that allow you to compare 11 topics between two different countries (OCDE members).

The topics measured are: **income, jobs, housing, health, access to services, environment, education, safety, civic engagement and governance, community, and life satisfaction**.
